<h2> Project nr 1 :A resturant page.</h2>
<img src="Screenshot_4-770x444.jpg" alt="">
<p>This is a webpage for a resutrant i developed as an individual project for my resturant owner
    <br>This was a startup buiseness from my friend and he wanted a website to introduce his resturant to customers.
    <br>I developed this webpage using a freely avaliable tool on the internet called <i>wix.</i>
    <br>The picture above was not how the website looked at the start, but after it was improved by experienced web developers.</p>

<h2>Project nr 2 : a <i>Youtube  </i>channel!</h2>
<img src="Untitled.png" alt=""width="770"height="444">
<p>This is my personal youtube channel i made back in 2016
    <br>I made this channel out of a passionate desire to share my innovative ideas with people!
    <br>This channel did not grow as much as i wanted to, but monetary gain was not my goal and i did it just as a hobby.
    <br>I learned through this project that sharing ideas and recieving feedback is really fun!
    <br>This project is now on hold. But i might return to it in the future if the oppurtunity arises!

<h2>Project nr 3: A <strong>custom</strong> built computer!</h2>
<img src="custom-computer-build.jpg" alt=""width="770"height="444">
<p>This is a computer i built back in 2018.
    <br>I bought the differnet parts individually from different sources and put together the whole thing.
    <br>Before building this computer i had to do some research regarding the compatibility of the different parts.
    <br>This project turned out a success! the computer was functioning and everything went well!!
    <br>I learned from this project to love building things, and not to be scared of experimentation.</p>
