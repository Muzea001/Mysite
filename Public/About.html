<h1>The following is my About page :</h1>
<h2>Preperation : </h2>
<p>Before writing the website, i made sure to categorize different pieces of content i wanted to include in my website
    into categories of importance.
    <br>The most important sentences were the titles of each individual page, in addition to the titles of each
    individual part of the page.
    <br>Following that i sorted out the words that i wanted to write underlined or bold, and what kinds of quotes or
    refernces i was going to include.
    <br> This made writing the syntax much easier as i had a clear picture of what kinds of semantics tags i wanted to
    use before even starting the writing process.
    <br>Along the way,i made several changes to the plan i had in advance as many times i found the tags i wanted to use
    were not appropriate, or that there were other more fitting tags to use.
    <br>I made use of list tags in my resume page, i also wanted to specifically use numeric lists whenever it felt
    appropriate.
<br>Lastly i used quote tags when writing my quotes, and used an hr tag to make a line seperating the title of the website from the content.</p>
<h2>Website structure : </h2>
<p>From the beginning I wanted the website to have a clear cut structure, what i mean by that is that we wanted the
    browser to be able to easlity navigate himself through the different pages
    and reach the specific piece of content he was looking for easily.
    <br>In order to do that we made sure that every tab on the website had a tag that linked the other 3 at the very
    top.Additionaly the homepage had links to all the different tabs.</p>
<h3>Images :</h3>
<p>Regarding the images used in the website, i made sure to resize every image so that it would fit perfectly, either
    with its description or with other images displayed on the same page.</p>
